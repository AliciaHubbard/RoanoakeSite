# RoanoakeSite
This was the final project for my advanced web design class.  It is a ficticious website for things to do in Roanoake where admins and the general community (submissions must be approved by admins) can add attractions.  

It is one of my earlier projects, so it doesn't access the database in a secure fashion and there is no spam protection on the public-facing web form.  Because of this, the code isn't live on my portfolio site (http://AliciaWebDeveloper.com).
